# Last Journal

Still haven't picked up on several topics in class. I've figured that being a slow learner isn't good when in class. I still haven't figured out a balance of what I should do in class: 80% code, 10% reading and hw? Code review would have helped tremendously. The last lab, book lab, was horrible. I couldn't help out at all on the project. I'm going to take responsibility and say that I should have commanded to do more, instead of letting the other person take control. But I didn't feel I had any ground to stand on since I really didn't know much.
